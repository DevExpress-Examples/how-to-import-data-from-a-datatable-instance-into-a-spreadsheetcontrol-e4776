# How to import data from a DataTable instance into a SpreadsheetControl


<p>This example illustrates how to import data from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datatable.aspx">DataTable Class</a> instance into a <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraSpreadsheetSpreadsheetControltopic">SpreadsheetControl</a>. We use the <strong>Worksheet.Import()</strong> overloaded method from the <strong>DevExpress.Spreadsheet.WorksheetExtensions</strong> class located in the <strong>DevExpress.Docs.vXY.Z.dll</strong> assembly. In addition, use the <strong>WorksheetCollection.ActiveWorksheet</strong> and <strong>Worksheet.SelectedCell</strong> properties to place the data relative to the selection in the SpreadsheetControl.</p><p></p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4751">How to import data to worksheet cells from different data sources and use tables</a></p>
